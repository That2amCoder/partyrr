# PARTYRR
## Intro
Welcome to *Partyrr*. An open source client for managing party music!  

You may wonder what exactly it does! Well I wonder that too.  

Essentially it is web based spotify queing system. You can allow anybody with an invite code to add music from their device onto your party playlist without passing your phone. It is in very early development, but tons of features are planned! It has a simple interface as shown below:
